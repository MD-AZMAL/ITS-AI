## Problem statement
---
High frequency of motor vehicles have caused a massive increase in traffic. Managing loads of traffic is more difficult then it ever was for any normal human to manage the traffic. As a result emergency cases such as ambulance, fire truck, police or any other vehicle in emergency can not reach their destination in time. Even in case of any accident it takes a significant amount of time to clear out the traffic at the scene. We have seen many innovations in various fields but one of the most crucial system is left untouched until we propose to solve it!

## IDEA
---
* AI driven traffic control system which will analyse the traffic junction via cctv and help in suggesting an optimal flow for the traffic based on the prediction and communicating the required information with nearby traffic junctions.

* With a near instant ability to solve major traffic congestion problems faced in cities with a large number of vehicle owners and smartly use available bandwidth of roads in the city.

## Advantages
---
* Major reduction of air pollution due to drastic reduction of stand still vehicles.

* Commute time reduction in the city greatly increases quality of life in the city.

* Real time tracking and surveillance of traffic flow to gain insight on better road development and accident response.
